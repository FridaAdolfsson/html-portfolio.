Gathering with friends for a game night is a favorite pastime, where strategy, friendly competition, and good company create lasting memories. These activities reflect my playful spirit and love for engaging interactions, making my leisure time both enjoyable and fulfilling.</p>

With my background in education and interest in technology, I have a unique combination of skills that can enrich my future role in IT.
